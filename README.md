### Software

This software is available in the following forms:

* [R-package](R_package)
* [Matlab-package](Matlab_package)
* Packages for Java and Python are under development
* We are working on getting PRG-curves implemented within various existing ROC packages in different languages, please e-mail us at meelis.kull@gmail.com to suggest your favourite package

### Authors

This software has been written by Meelis Kull, based on work by Peter Flach and Meelis Kull, see http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~flach/PRGcurves/.
